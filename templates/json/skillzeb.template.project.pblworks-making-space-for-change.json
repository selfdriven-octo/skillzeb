			"summary": "Create an environmentally sustainable redesign for a community space, such as a park, library, public square, empty lot, or community center. Students visit the space; research the local context, needs, resources, and constraints; and investigate principles of environmentally sustainable design. Engage in the critique and revision processes that involve local community members and then present your solutions to key stakeholders",
